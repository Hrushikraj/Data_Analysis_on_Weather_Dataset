<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Data Analysis is one major part that you must master before learning or diving into the machine learning algorithms section because data analysis is a process to explore the data to get a better understanding of data.</p>
<h1>Dataset Overview</h1>
<p>The dataset we will use is a simple weather dataset which is a time-series dataset that stores the temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc on an hourly basis on different dates in 2012Load Dataset.</p>
<h1>Load Dataset</h1>
<p>You have the dataset and open the Jupyter Notebook or you can also create a Kaggle notebook over there itself. The first step is to import the necessary libraries and load the dataset into a notebook.</p>
<h1>Basic Python Pandas Data Analysis Functions</h1>
<h3>1. Shape</h3>

  ```bash
 data.shape
```
  <h3>2. Data types</h3>
  
  ```bash
 data.dtypes
```

<h3>3. Unique </h3>
  
   ```bash
 data['Weather'].unique()
```
  
<h3>4. Count</h3>
  
   ```bash
 data.count()
```
  
<h3>5. Value counts</h3>
  
   ```bash
 data['Weather'].value_counts()
```
  
<h3>6.information</h3>
  
   ```bash
 data.info
```
  
<h3>7.Describe</h3>
  
   ```bash
data.describe()
```

<h1>Answering Different Data Analysis Problems</h1>
<h3>Q1)To check if there are null values and drop them</h3>
<h3>Q2) To find unique instances of weather types</h3>
<h3>Q3) To rename column named 'Weather' to Weather Condition'</h3>
<h3>Q4)To find all records from data of when the weather was exactly clear ?</h3>
<h3>Q5)To find the mean temperature, wind speed and visibility?</h3>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Q6)To find the variance of pressure ?</h3>
<h3>Q7) To Find the Days in which wind speed was more then 30km/h & temperature is greater then 0C?</h3>
<h3>Q8) To find the date and temperatures for all instances when snow was recorded</h3>
<h3>Q9) To display a graph of variation of temperature with respect to time ?</h3>
<h3>Q10) To display a pie chart of percentages of weather conditions (pie chart)</h3>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Data analysis is a continuous process that represents how deep and better you represent your analysis to the client so the insights that can be used to drive business decisions are understandable.</p>
